# Nomad2018-Predicting-Transparent-Conductors
Predicting bandgap and formation energy of semiconductors with crystal data.

With this submission, reached 80/896 on private leaderboard on kaggle (top 10%), but was 13 minutes past the deadline...
The private score (remaining 83% of their test data) was 0.0643 root mean square error.

If I had more time, I would have liked to do more feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning.
 
Code to generate xyz data features was borrowed from Tony Y. https://www.kaggle.com/tonyyy/how-to-get-atomic-coordinates 
PCA code for xyz data was borrowed from DatumX https://www.kaggle.com/janpreets/using-the-atomic-coordinates-for-prediction
